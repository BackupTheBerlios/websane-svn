		<title>Website launched</title>
		<doc>
			<p>
			This website was launced today. The entire site is automagically rebuilt each night from the xml sources in 
			the subversion repository. A script fetches the subversion sources, and runs xml proc on the xml files using 
			an xslt stylesheet to create the site. Each part of the site is stored in a separate file that only contains 
			data. What is to built is written the 
			<a href="website/xml/site.xml">site.xml</a> 
			file, and based on that the
			xslt processor goes through the files and creates menus and links, in essence creates the entire site. 
			</p>
			<p>
			You can find the sources for the builder in our svn repository or simply under the 
			<a href="website">website directory</a>
