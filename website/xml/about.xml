<h3>About WebSANE</h3>
<p>
WebSANE aims to make sharing a scanner to multiple clients easy. In addition
the clients do not need any special software to operate the scanner remotely, they
simply point their web browsers to the computer to which the scanner is connected.
</p>
<p>
At this point there is only a web demo of the interface and the backend which is to be written in 
php is missing. The frontend currently requires a gecko based browser. The demo also mostly works
with Internet Explorer 6.
</p>
<p>
WebSANE was inspired by the work Gunars Benga did on the <a href="http://sanewi.sourceforge.net">SANE Web Interface</a> 
project.

<h3>About this site</h3>
<p>
The contents of this site are actually in the project's subversion repository. Each page
is described there in xml and each nigh a script is run that checks for updates. It
downloads new versions of the xml files and using xmlproc rebuilds the entire site.
</p>
<p>
For the site maintainers this means that each version of a page will be stored automatically
and accessible later. It also means that adding links to the sidebar can be easily done and when
the pages are re-build the link will automagically appear on every page. 
</p>
<p>
All the relevant files can be found in the <a href="website">website directory</a> or in the svn repository.
