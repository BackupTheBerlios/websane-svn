<h3>About WebSANE</h3>
<p>
WebSANE aims to make sharing a scanner to multiple clients easy. In addition
the clients do not need any special software to operate the scanner remotely, they
simply point their web browsers to the computer to which the scanner is connected.
</p>
<p>
What this means is that you can easily share a printer connected to a linux machine with
clients connected on Windows boxes. Since there is no configuration needed for the client part,
you only need to be able to install software on the linux box. Let's say a school has a computer class with
several computer but just one scanner. With WebSANE's simple interface anyone can use the scanner, and
they can use it from their computer, not the computer attached to the scanner. Easy and elegant.
</p>
<p>
The backend is written in python and the frontend uses HTML+CSS+Javascript. The frontend currently requires a browser based on 
the gecko engine, though Opera and KHTML also mostly work. The demo works
with Internet Explorer 6, but the actual program functions very poorly with IE6.

<p>
WebSANE was inspired by the work Gunars Benga did on the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sanewi/">SANE Web Interface</a> project.

<h3>About this site</h3>
<p>
The contents of this site are actually in the project's subversion repository. Each page
is described there in xml and each nigh a script is run that checks for updates. It
downloads new versions of the xml files and using xmlproc rebuilds the entire site.
</p>
<p>
For the site maintainers this means that each version of a page will be stored automatically
and accessible later. It also means that adding links to the sidebar can be easily done and when
the pages are re-build the link will automagically appear on every page. 
</p>
<p>
All the relevant files can be found in the <a href="website">website directory</a> or in the svn repository.
