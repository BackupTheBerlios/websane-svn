The main program is a python script named 
websane.py in the src directory. 

Check out the config files for configuration 
options.

You should extract the entire filestructure and 
run the script from its own directory. 

When you run the websane script it will create
a webserver on your machine's local port 5423 
and should point your (Gecko based) browser to 
http://127.0.0.1:5423/demo.html to view the 
interface. A lot of information (and possible
errors) will be printed out by the websane.py
script, so keep an eye on it for errors.

By default it will serve out files from the 
../demo (relative to the place from which it
was started).

Files are saved in a secure way, and when the
python script exits it will delete the files.
This means that if the script crashes, you will
not loose you scans. If you exit normally all
scanned files will be deleted.
